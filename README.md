# portfolio-project
Django Portfolio Project #2 from Nick Walter's Django 2 and Python 3 course on Udemy.

The goal of this project is to create a portfolio website consisting of two apps: jobs and blogs.

The jobs app returns an entry from the database posted by the admin consisting of a title and picture.

The blogs app is similar to the jobs app, but allows the client to click on a blog link to be taken to a blog page with one big picture followed by text.
